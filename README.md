# Project Maze Game - A Collaboration Project
 A maze type of game, simmiliar to pacman with extra challenges. yeah thats about it.
 theres supposed to be more mechanics, but it gets so complicated for a maze game that we scrapped it, 
 
 but were using it in our next game!
 
# Building & Playing
 Theres no build released for this game.
 
 This game is made using the Construct Engine, you could try and search that on google and load the project there
 then you can load the .c3p file in the source and play the game in-engine

# Mechanics
 Advanced AI for the enemy
 yeah lol thats it
